![emoji](https://autism.crd.co/assets/images/gallery07/4181e873_original.gif?v=1be2f3c4) Much of my free time is spent on niche interests such as;
* updating the profiles of my [toyhou.se characters](toyhou.se/mindsmisery)
* or otherwise enhancing my other game profiles for a better look.

* Creating F2U profile codes in HTML to use in toyhou.se
   * And later perhaps some CSS snippets
* Eventually creating my own video game ~(probably a visual novel)~
