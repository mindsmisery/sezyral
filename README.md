* updating the HTML profiles of my [toyhou.se characters](https://toyhou.se/mindsmisery)
* or otherwise enhancing my other game profiles for a better look.

* Creating F2U profile codes in HTML to use in toyhou.se
   * And later perhaps some CSS snippets
* Eventually creating my own video game ~(probably a visual novel)~
